endl vs \n in C++

Although they both seem to do the same thing, there is a subtle difference between them.

cout << endl  : Inserts a new line and flushes the stream

cout << "\n"  : Only inserts a new line.

Therefore,

cout << endl;


can be said equivalent to

cout << ‘\n’ << flush;

So cout << “\n” seems performance wise better than cout << endl; unless flushing of stream is required.

Some other differences between endl and \n are:

    endl is manipulator while \n is character.
    endl doesn’t occupy any memory whereas \n is character so It occupy 1 byte memory.
    We cannot write endl in between double quotation while we can write \n in between double quotation like
    cout<<"\n"; it is right but cout<<"endl"; is wrong.
    We can use \n also in C++ but we can't use endl in C language.
